## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/desktop-preview.png)

This project is a fully responsive "Meet the Team" grid layout. The goal was to build a clean, premium UI that scales flawlessly from a 4-column enterprise desktop view down to a single-column mobile feed without losing structural integrity.

### What I learned

Layering & Z-Index: Learned how to stack text and gradients over images using absolute positioning.

Responsive Grid: Mastered grid-template-areas to snap the layout between 4, 3, and 1 columns depending on the device.

Centering & Viewports: Used Flexbox and 100vh to lock the content perfectly in the center of the screen.

Hover Effects: Implemented smooth image scaling to make the UI feel interactive and premium.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
